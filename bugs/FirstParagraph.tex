It appears that the first paragraph on a page is not put into paragraph tags. For example, process this document with Ximera and click on "view source"; this paragraph is not in a paragraph, div, or even span, but the following two are. This affects the amount of space between this paragraph and the next, making the text more difficult to read.

This is a paragraph of text, just sitting here. It consists of several sentences ov varying length. Some are short. Some are a little bit longer, but not much. Some sentences ramble on and on, with several subclauses, the only purpose of which seems to be to take up space on the page -- or browser, as the case may be -- with little to no payoff for the reader.

Here we have yet another paragraph of text. Note how, much like the previous, this text has little purpose other than to take up space. It might just as well consist of the words "Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah", with no difference in semantic content.
